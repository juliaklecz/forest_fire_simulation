# forest_fire_simulation
Project which is a simulation of a forest fire. Using moisture map underneath the picture and amoutn of nearby burning trees calculates probability of catching fire. Random wind direction (east, north, south, west) which also influaces which way the fire spreads the fastest. Three ways of extinguishing the fire: 
- dropping water from a plane (using left mouse key)
- sending firefighters from a choosen direction (arrow keys)
- probability of rain (more than 0.6) -> really fast technique
U will need an image in png format to run this program.
